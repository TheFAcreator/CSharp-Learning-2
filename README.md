### All exercises from the second part of my C# learning.
To be clear, these exercises are on more advanced topics and are a lot more than the first part of the learning.
They are significantly harder and longer and some projects even have references to other projects in the same solution which is something that none of the exercises of [C# Learning Part 1](https://github.com/TheFAcreator/CSharp-Learning-1) have.
