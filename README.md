### All exercises from the second part of my C# learning.
To be clear, these exercises are on more advanced topics and are a lot more than the first part of the learning.
They are significantly harder and longer and some projects even have references to other projects in the same solution which is something that none of the exercises of [C# Learning Part 1](https://github.com/TheFAcreator/CSharp-Learning-1) have.

Exercises are from three types: **Basics -> Fundamentals -> Advanced**

Each topic from these types is a solution which contains multiple projects which solve various exercises. These projects are stored in 2 in-solution folders: Lab, Exercise (***some*** with a third - More Exercise). Lab stores introductory tasks and Exercise contains harder tasks which are a practical use of the new knowledge (hence way longer and more complex). More Exercise folders contain additional exercises with a higher complexity. You can check out the .sln file of each topic where I have added comments so that these projects (lab, exercise, more exercise) are separated. From there you can find out which projects belong to the Lab folder and which to Exercise. Note that not all topics have lab and exercise folders.
## In the table below are listed all solutions (topics).
##### Topics marked with a ⭐ are important and complex C# stuff. Topics marked with ⭐⭐⭐ are actual **whole projects** with a practical use. Exercises that have (!) in end of their names are *extra exercises* meaning that they are more complex than the other in the topic they are part of.

###### Important notes: The order of commits isn't equal to the order of exercise creation. In order to see the correct solution structure, try loading the solution in your IDE.

| Topic | Type       | Number of exercises |
